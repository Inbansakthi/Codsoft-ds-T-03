# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project uses the classic **Iris flower dataset** to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The model learns from the flower's **sepal** and **petal measurements** to predict its species.  
This is a classic introductory classification task in machine learning.

## 📂 Dataset
The Iris dataset includes:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)
- Species (target variable)

*(Dataset used: `IRIS.csv` — you can also use sklearn's built-in iris dataset.)*

---

## ✅ Objectives
- Explore and understand the Iris dataset.
- Visualize relationships between features and species.
- Preprocess data and prepare it for modeling.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to classify flower species.
- Gain insights into which measurements help differentiate species.

## ⚙️ Steps
1. **Data Exploration & Visualization**
   - Histograms, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Check for missing values and data types.
   - Split data into training and test sets.
3. **Modeling**
   - Train classification models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest.
   - Tune hyperparameters if needed.
4. **Evaluation**
   - Use accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
   - Compare model performance.
5. **Insights**
   - See which features are most important for predicting the species.

## 📦 Libraries Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib & seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of about **XX%** on the test set (replace with your actual result).  
Key observations:
- Petal length and width are the most discriminative features.
- Setosa species is linearly separable from the other two.
